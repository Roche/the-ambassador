advice.visibility.private.reason=Project is private
advice.visibility.private.details=When your repository is private, it can't be found nor explored by anyone. \
  It severely impacts culture of sharing and learning. Consider opening your project to broader community, \
  which would support adopting an open source mindset to software development, closing organizational gaps \
  and breaking down silos. As a first move, consider making your project internally accessible by people \
  within organization. You should consider changing project visibility to at least internal unless you \
  project is bound to internal restrictions like forbidden collaboration between specific departments, \
  is secret project obliged to be kept privat or project contains secrets that can't be leaked even \
  internally (e.g. secret data, passwords, keys). <br/> \
  Additionally, if you make your project visibility less strict, you would benefit from having more \
  insights and advices coming from me, your Ambassador.
advice.visibility.private.remediation=Change project visibility to internal (for the beginning) or \
  public (if supported). Go to `Settings -> General -> Visibility, project features, permissions` \
  and change `Project visibility`. Additionally, allow everyone to view at minimum issues and repository, \
  create pull requests and fork your project.

advice.description.missing.reason=Missing project description

  Well written description makes it possible for the others to understand the goal of the projects.

  It is recommended to make description at least {0} chars long to keep it sufficiently descriptive.

advice.description.short.reason=Project description is too short
advice.description.short.details=Description in this project is {0} chars long, while recommended \
  length is {1}. Aim is to make description useful and easy to understand to others. \
  Too short description very likely is not descriptive enough to understand goal of the project.
advice.description.short.remediation=Increase length of project description to make it more descriptive. \
  Go to `Settings -> General` and modify `Project description` It is recommended to use at least {1} chars.

advice.topics.missing.reason=Missing topics
advice.topics.missing.details=Topics are labels that create subject-based connections between repositories and let \
  you explore projects by type, technology, business area.. To help other people find and contribute to your project, \
  you should add topics to your repository related to your project's intended purpose, technology, subject area, \
  affinity groups, or other important qualities.
advice.topics.missing.remediation=Add topics to project. Go to `Settings -> General` and modify `Topics`. \
  It is recommended to re-use existing topics and create new only when really needed.

advice.topics.too-few.details=Topics are labels that create subject-based connections between repositories and let \
  you explore projects by type, technology, business area.. To help other people find and contribute to your project, \
  you should **add more** topics than just TOPICS-COUNT-REF, to your repository related to your project's intended purpose, \
  technology, subject area, affinity groups, or other important qualities.

  external contributions.
