## <a id="about"></a> ✨ About

The Ambassador helps users of coding platforms to create findable, well maintained,
properly documented and secure projects. It's purpose is to promote creating
Open Source and InnerSource software, that others can rely on.
It measures project scores (criticality, activity, scorecard), proactively advises projects
and provides a handy API for querying indexed and rated projects.

### <a id="motivation"></a> 💡 Motivation

- Automate analysis of quality posture of software projects
- Proactively notify projects' about potential improvements they can implement
- Help build a community of professionals openly sharing code
- Rate projects that are following good Open and InnerSource practices
- Discover dependencies between projects, packages, people and organizations

It is inspired by [OSSF Security Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard),
[InnerSource Patterns](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns)
and... life 😄
