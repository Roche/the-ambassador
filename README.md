create findable, well documented and offering good quality projects.
It measures project scores (criticality, activity, scorecard),
and provides a handy API for querying indexed and rated projects.

## üí° Motivation

- Automate analysis of quality posture of software projects
- Proactively notify projects' about potential improvements they can implement
- Help build a community of professionals openly sharing code
- Rate projects that are following good Open and Inner Source practices

It is inspired by [OSSF Security Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard),
[InnerSource Patterns](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns)
